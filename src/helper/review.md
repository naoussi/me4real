Well done in addressing the issues raised back in the previous review.
This question below ( which you had in your screening section) should not be a screening question as if the user answers no. you exploit the pain points and reasons why they will not consider in your app that way you end up with a better product. if they answer yes you still go ahead to know their reason so as to maintain what and why they like. remember feedback is always important as a UX researcher.
